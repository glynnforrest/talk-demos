# Caring for a pet Jenkins

The Jenkins automation server is one of the most well-known tools for continuous integration and delivery. It is extremely versatile, catering for almost any use case through its vast array of plugins.

However, this flexibility comes at a price. It's easy for Jenkins to become a manually configured 'pet' server that people are scared to touch. In today's age of automated infrastructure as code, this poses a significant risk to a project.

In this talk, we'll investigate strategies to alleviate these risks. We'll talk about setting up Jenkins in an automated fashion, and tools to install plugins and manage jobs. We'll also look into running Jenkins on schedulers such as Kubernetes and Nomad, as well as best practices for clean builds using containers.
