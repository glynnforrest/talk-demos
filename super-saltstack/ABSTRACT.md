# Super SaltStack - Event Driven Orchestration and Configuration Management

Salt, Puppet, Chef, Ansible - which one to choose? Learn what makes SaltStack stand out from other configuration management solutions, and how you can use the built-in orchestration engine, event bus, reactor, cloud, beacons, and much more, to take your operations to the next level.

We'll see how to get started in less than 5 minutes, and look at some good practices to follow as your infrastructure grows. We'll go beyond configuration management and look into reacting to incidents, self healing-infrastructure, auto-scaling, and other use cases.

We'll also examine some of Salt's weaknesses, and where other tools can be used as inspiration for improvement.
